## AI Implementation

The AI opponent in this Chinese Chess game is powered by OpenAI's GPT models, implementing a sophisticated analysis system that considers multiple strategic factors:

### Core Components
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model for move generation and analysis
- Implements UCI (Universal Chinese Chess Interface) move format
- FEN (Forsyth‚ÄìEdwards Notation) position representation for board state

### Strategic Analysis Factors
The AI evaluates positions based on several key aspects:
- **Material Balance**: Analyzes the difference in piece count and value between players
- **Piece Activity**: Evaluates mobility and positioning of pieces, particularly high-value pieces
- **King Safety**: Assesses the security of both Generals and potential threats
- **Center Control**: Prioritizes control of key central positions
- **Pawn Structure**: Analyzes pawn formations and advancement opportunities
- **Tactical Opportunities**: Identifies potential captures, forks, pins, and other tactical motifs

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// The AI processes each move through these steps:
1. Convert current board state to FEN notation
2. Generate a strategic analysis prompt
3. Process through GPT model with temperature 0.4 for consistent play
4. Validate returned moves using UCI format
5. Execute validated moves on the game board
```

### Difficulty Levels
The AI supports multiple difficulty settings through different strategic prompts:
- Beginner: Makes simple moves with occasional minor mistakes
- Intermediate: Employs basic tactics and solid strategic principles
- Advanced: Focuses on deep tactical analysis and optimal play

The AI's responses are structured in JSON format, ensuring consistent and valid move generation while maintaining strategic depth in gameplay.
