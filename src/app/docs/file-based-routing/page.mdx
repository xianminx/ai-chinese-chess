summary: A demo to show using file based routing for mdx, just like regular app routing page.tsx in Next.js.

import HelloMDX from "./hello-mdx";
import {
  default as ChildMDX,
  frontmatter as childFrontmatter,
} from "./child.mdx";


## MDX Using file based routing

File based routing is a feature that allows you to create pages by placing files in the `app` directory.

For example, this page is located at `src/app/docs/file-based-routing/page.mdx`.

See more: [Using file based routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#using-file-based-routing)

### Import React Component

Just like you would do in a normal React component.

```tsx
import HelloMDX from "../content/hello-mdx";

<HelloMDX />;
```

<p />

<HelloMDX />

### Import another MDX file

```tsx
import ChildMDX, { metadata } from "./child.mdx";
```

* **Child frontmatter**
  This is the frontmatter metadata of the child page.

  > Note: the remark-mdx-frontmatter plugin, which is used to extract the frontmatter metadata from the MDX file, exports the metadata as `frontmatter``
  but it may conflict with the `frontmatter` in the current page. So we rename it to `childFrontmatter` to avoid conflict.

  <div className="relative p-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-slate-100">
    <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 pl-4">
      {Object.keys(childFrontmatter).map((key) => (
        <li className="text-gray-800 font-medium text-sm" key={key}>
          <span className="font-bold">{key}:</span> {childFrontmatter[key]}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>

* **Child page content**
  <div className="relative p-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-slate-200">
      <ChildMDX />
  </div>

### katex

```math
C_L = \frac{L}{q S}
```

### remark-breaks
You may test `remark-breaks` to break the line.
```ts
// next.config.js
const withMDX = configMdx({
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [['remark-breaks']],
  },
});

```
When `remark-breaks` is enabled, the line break will be converted to a line break.

It will go to the next line when you press enter.
This is the second line.

### Table

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
| Cell 7   | Cell 8   | Cell 9   |
