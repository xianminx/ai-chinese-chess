## What is MDX?


## How does MDX work with Next.js?


Next.js -> webpack -> loader -> mdx -> react components

remark plugins and rehype plugins

remark: parse markdown to mdx

rehype: convert mast to hast and then to html





MDX  compiled to React components and rendered on the page. 

service side rendering
rsc 

client side rendering



## How to use MDX in Next.js

### Static page or app routing like page.tsx 
This is the simplest way to use MDX in Next.js. 

1. Create a new page in the app directory `app/docs/static-mdx-page/page.mdx`
2. Add the MDX content to the page. You can write it as plain markdown or even use React components. This is just like how you write a tsx file, but with markdown and component code. 
3. The page will be rendered on the server side and the MDX content will be compiled to React components, and the page will be served as an HTML file. 
You can access the page at `http://localhost:3000/docs/static-mdx-page`, just like any other tsx page in Next.js. 

Here the basic setting is to config 'mdx' support in next.config.ts
```ts
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ["ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"],
   ...
}
```

If you want to support GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can add the following plugins in remarkPlugins and rehypePlugins in next.config.ts
```ts
// next.config.ts
import configMdx from "@next/mdx";
// import moonlightTheme from './assets/moonlight-ii.json' with { type: 'json' };

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const withMDX = configMdx({
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [['remark-gfm'], ['remark-frontmatter'], ['remark-mdx-frontmatter'], ['remark-math']],
    rehypePlugins: [['rehype-katex', { strict: true, throwOnError: true }], ['rehype-mathjax'], 
    ['rehype-slug'], ['rehype-pretty-code', {  keepBackground: true,}],
  ],
  },
});
```

More or less, based on your requirement, you can add more plugins in remarkPlugins and rehypePlugins. 





### Dynamic page like [slug].tsx



### Remote MDX like MDXRemote



## Styling with tailwind and `@tailwind/typography`
