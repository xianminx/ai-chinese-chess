### FastAPI 文档

How It Works
The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under /api/.

This is implemented using next.config.js rewrites to map any request to /api/py/:path* to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the /api folder.

Also, the app/api routes are available on the same domain, so you can use NextJs Route Handlers and make requests to /api/....

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the 127.0.0.1:8000 port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as Python serverless functions on Vercel.
